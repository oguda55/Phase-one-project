Contributing to the accident were (1) Saab\u0092s design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the Federal Aviation Administration\u0092s lack of consideration of the runway safety area dimensions at Unalaska Airport during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers\u0092 inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturer\u0092s limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAir\u0092s failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in\u0002-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAir\u0092s route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane.","Publication.Date":"01-12-2021"},{"Event.Id":"20191020X10854","Investigation.Type":"Accident","Accident.Number":"ERA20WA015","Event.Date":"2019-10-18","Location":"Nassau, Bahamas","Country":"Bahamas","Latitude":"025533N","Longitude":"0773017W","Airport.Code":"Unknown","Airport.Name":"John F.
